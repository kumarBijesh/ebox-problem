         Mr. Gowtham is a football player. While he playing he thought of finding an area of the circle which is marked white in the center of the ground.

 

Can u write a program to find the area of the circle.

 

Create a class called Circle. Create a static method name called calArea with one float arguments and return type of float.

 

In the main method call calArea function from Circle class without creating object for class Circle..

Note: Please have pi values as 22/7.

 

Input and Output Format:

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

 

Sample Input and Output:

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]

 

Sample Input and Output 1:

Enter the radius of circle :

5

The area of circle is 78.57.

 

Sample Input and Output 2:

Enter the radius of circle :

10

The area of circle is 314.29. 



           import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter the radius of circle :\n");

float radius = sc.nextFloat(); // Use float for radius
float pi = 22.0f / 7.0f; // Approximate pi value

 float circleArea = pi * radius * radius;

System.out.printf("The area of circle is %.2f.\n", circleArea);
  }
  }
