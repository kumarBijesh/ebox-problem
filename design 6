This program is to illustrate Integer Wrapper class.

 

Write a program that accepts a “Integer” class type value as input and invokes some of the methods defined in the Integer Wrapper class.

 

Refer sample input and output. All functions should be performed using the methods defined in the Integer class.

 

Input and Output Format:

 

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.

 

Sample Input and Output :

 

Enter an integer

540

The binary equivalent of 540 is 1000011100

The hexadecimal equivalent of 540 is 21c

The octal equivalent of 540 is 1034

Byte value of 540 is 28

Short value of 540 is 540

Long value of 540 is 540

Float value of 540 is 540.0

Double value of 540 is 540.0
